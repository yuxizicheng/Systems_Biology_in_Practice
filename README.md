This is the course project of Systems_Biology_in_Practice at Uva, I applied interdisciplinary approach to experimental microbial physiology, encompassing transcriptome and proteome analyses. And also explored how information derived from experiments at the cellular behavior, genetic profile, and enzymatic makeup levels can be integrated to understand the mechanisms governing the regulation and adaptation of microbial organisms. And also got familiar with fundamental techniques and principles of microbial physiology, transcriptome analysis, mass spectrometry, and data analysis.
